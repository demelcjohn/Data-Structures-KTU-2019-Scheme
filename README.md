2. Write a menu driven C Program ,to do the following operations using a stack
datastructure:
a) Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression
b) Evaluate the postfix expression

3. Write a program to read two polynomials and store them in an array. Calculate the
sum of the two polynomials and display the first polynomial, second polynomial and
the resultant polynomial.

4. Write a C program to enter two matrices in normal form . Do the following
operations, implemented as separate functions:

b. Insert elements to the Rear of the queue
c. Delete elements from the Front of the queue.
d. Delete elements from the Rear of the queue.
e. Display the queue after each operation

8. Write a menu driven C Program to implement a Priority Queue using arrays with the
following operations:
a. Insert elements to the Priority Queue.
b. Delete elements from the Priority Queue.
c. Display the contents of the Priority Queue after each operation

9. Write a C program to create a structure Employee with fields EmpId, Name and
Salary. Name should contain first name, middle name and last name. Store the details
of n employees, dynamically allocating memory for the same. Write a function to
implement Linear Search to search for a particular employee, given the EmpId.

10. Write a C program to read string data stored in a file. Sort the strings in alphabetical
order using Bubble Sort. Implement Binary Search to search for a given string.
Implement sort and search routines as separate functions.
